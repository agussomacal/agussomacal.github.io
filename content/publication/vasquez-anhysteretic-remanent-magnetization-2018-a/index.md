abstract: A phenomenological model based on a linear relationship between the magnetic
  coercivity field and the reciprocal of the grain diameter is applied to explain
  the anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) imparted to artificial samples with
  different concentrations of a very well characterized magnetite powder. By analyses
  of scanning electron microscopy images, the spherically shaped single domain synthetic
  magnetite is found to follow a lognormal grain size distribution with 86 nm of
  mean diameter. The proposed model, fitted to ARM measurements up to a peak alternating
  field of 100 mT, yields a very good agreement. The coercivity behaviour predicted
  by micromagnetism theory disagrees with the experimental results of this work. A
  likely explanation for the discrepancy is that the magnetite particles, which consist
  of a mixture of grains in coherent rotation and curling modes, produce similar observations
  as domain processes.
