abstract: We consider a parametric elliptic PDE with a scalar piecewise constant diffusion
  coefficient taking arbitrary positive values on fixed subdomains. This problem is
  not uniformly elliptic, as the contrast can be arbitrarily high, contrary to the
  Uniform Ellipticity Assumption (UEA) that is commonly made on parametric elliptic
  PDEs. We construct reduced model spaces that approximate uniformly well all solutions
  with estimates in relative error that are independent of the contrast level. These
  estimates are sub-exponential in the reduced model dimension, yet exhibiting the
  curse of dimensionality as the number of subdomains grows. Similar estimates are
  obtained for the Galerkin projection, as well as for the state estimation and parameter
  estimation inverse problems. A key ingredient in our construction and analysis is
  the study of the convergence towards limit solutions of stiff problems when diffusion
  tends to infinity in certain domains.
