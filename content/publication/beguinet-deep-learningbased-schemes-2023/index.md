abstract: Deep learning-based numerical schemes such as Physically Informed Neural
  Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as an alternative to classical numerical
  schemes for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). They are very appealing
  at first sight because implementing vanilla versions of PINNs based on strong residual
  forms is easy, and neural networks offer very high approximation capabilities. However,
  when the PDE solutions are low regular, an expert insight is required to build deep
  learning formulations that do not incur in variational crimes. Optimization solvers
  are also significantly challenged, and can potentially spoil the final quality of
  the approximated solution due to the convergence to bad local minima, and bad generalization
  capabilities. In this paper, we present an exhaustive numerical study of the merits
  and limitations of these schemes when solutions exhibit low-regularity, and compare
  performance with respect to more benign cases when solutions are very smooth. As
  a support for our study, we consider singularly perturbed convection-diffusion problems
  where the regularity of solutions typically degrades as certain multiscale parameters
  go to zero.
