abstract: We consider the problem of real-time reconstruction of urban air pollution
  maps. The task is challenging due to the heterogeneous sources of available data,
  the scarcity of direct measurements, the presence of noise, and the large surfaces
  that need to be considered. In this work, we introduce different reconstruction
  methods based on posing the problem on city graphs. Our strategies can be classified
  as fully data-driven, physics-driven, or hybrid, and we combine them with super-learning
  models. The performance of the methods is tested in the case of the inner city of
  Paris, France.
