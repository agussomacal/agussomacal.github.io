 abstract = {We consider the problem of real-time reconstruction of urban air pollution maps. The task is challenging due to the heterogeneous sources of available data, the scarcity of direct measurements, the presence of noise, and the large surfaces that need to be considered. In this work, we introduce different reconstruction methods based on posing the problem on city graphs. Our strategies can be classified as fully data-driven, physics-driven, or hybrid, and we combine them with super-learning models. The performance of the methods is tested in the case of the inner city of Paris, France.},
