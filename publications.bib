  abstract = {Deep learning-based numerical schemes such as Physically Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as an alternative to classical numerical schemes for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). They are very appealing at first sight because implementing vanilla versions of PINNs based on strong residual forms is easy, and neural networks offer very high approximation capabilities. However, when the PDE solutions are low regular, an expert insight is required to build deep learning formulations that do not incur in variational crimes. Optimization solvers are also significantly challenged, and can potentially spoil the final quality of the approximated solution due to the convergence to bad local minima, and bad generalization capabilities. In this paper, we present an exhaustive numerical study of the merits and limitations of these schemes when solutions exhibit low-regularity, and compare performance with respect to more benign cases when solutions are very smooth. As a support for our study, we consider singularly perturbed convection-diffusion problems where the regularity of solutions typically degrades as certain multiscale parameters go to zero.},

  abstract = {We consider a parametric elliptic PDE with a scalar piecewise constant diffusion coefficient taking arbitrary positive values on fixed subdomains. This problem is not uniformly elliptic, as the contrast can be arbitrarily high, contrary to the Uniform Ellipticity Assumption (UEA) that is commonly made on parametric elliptic PDEs. We construct reduced model spaces that approximate uniformly well all solutions with estimates in relative error that are independent of the contrast level. These estimates are sub-exponential in the reduced model dimension, yet exhibiting the curse of dimensionality as the number of subdomains grows. Similar estimates are obtained for the Galerkin projection, as well as for the state estimation and parameter estimation inverse problems. A key ingredient in our construction and analysis is the study of the convergence towards limit solutions of stiff problems when diffusion tends to infinity in certain domains.},

In this work, we introduce different reconstruction methods based on posing the problem on city graphs. Our strategies can be classified as fully data-driven, physics-driven, or hybrid, and we combine them with super-learning models. The performance of the methods is tested in the case of the inner city of Paris, France.},

  abstract = {A phenomenological model based on a linear relationship between the magnetic coercivity field and the reciprocal of the grain diameter is applied to explain the anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) imparted to artificial samples with different concentrations of a very well characterized magnetite powder. By analyses of scanning electron microscopy images, the spherically shaped single domain synthetic magnetite is found to follow a lognormal grain size distribution with 86 nm of mean diameter. The proposed model, fitted to ARM measurements up to a peak alternating field of 100 mT, yields a very good agreement. The coercivity behaviour predicted by micromagnetism theory disagrees with the experimental results of this work. A likely explanation for the discrepancy is that the magnetite particles, which consist of a mixture of grains in coherent rotation and curling modes, produce similar observations as domain processes.},
